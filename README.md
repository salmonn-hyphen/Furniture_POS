# Furniture_POS

This project is my practice work for a React course, focusing on building a Point of Sale (POS) system for a furniture store. The application is being built with both a frontend and backend. I am using React and TypeScript for the frontend, and a backend (technology to be determined or in progress) to handle data persistence and business logic.

## Project Goals

- **Hands-On React Practice:** This POS application helps me apply the concepts learned in my React course, including state management, component composition, and hooks.
- **TypeScript Integration:** By using TypeScript, I aim to write safer and more maintainable code, taking advantage of static typing and modern JavaScript features.
- **Full Stack Experience:** Integrating a backend for this project allows me to practice API design, CRUD operations, and connecting frontend to backend.
- **UI/UX Experience:** The project gives me a chance to design and build user interfaces that are both functional and user-friendly.
- **Real-World Scenarios:** Developing a POS system simulates solving practical problems, such as managing product inventories, processing sales, and handling user interactions.
